An initial PCA plot indicates that sample miA_1_S5 is an outlier. It will be removed before further analysis. 

per Rachel O'Neill, a few other samples had some issues, they will be removed as well.

No single samples explain huge amounts of variance in this plot, so it's improved, but now we have very poor replication (2/treatment) and the treatments still don't group.
