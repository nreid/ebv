![Figure 1](figs/1_PCAv1.png)

An initial PCA plot indicates that sample miA_1_S5 is an outlier. It will be removed before further analysis.

No single samples explain huge amounts of variance in this plot, so it's improved. However, we don't see any grouping of treatments, which foreshadows ambiguous results to come.
